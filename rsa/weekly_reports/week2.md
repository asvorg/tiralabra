## Week 2

- Can now generate primes of size up to ~~50 bits within a reasonable time, still working on this~~, 1024 bit primes now generated in reasonable time.
- Started working on key generation. Calculation of d doesn't seem to be working properly yet. 
- Using static 65537 as e for now, will probably change this later on.
- Lot of testing of the prime generation functions. ~~Primes are now correct, but generation is very slow.~~
- Started working on benchmarking
- Started testing just a little bit.
