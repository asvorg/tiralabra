## Week 2

- Can now generate primes of size up to 50 bits within a reasonable time, still working on this
- Started working on key generation. Calculation of d doesn't seem to be working properly yet. 
- Using static 65537 as e for now, will probably change this later on.
- Lot of testing of the prime generation functions. Primes are now correct, but generation is very slow.
- Started testing just a little bit.
