- Implemented working version of the extended Euclidean algorithm, d calculation works now
- Fixed an issue with the Miller Rabin primality test returning always true
- The core functionality now done
- ~~ ~~Still some strange bug which makes the program crash sometimes, the frequency seems to be increasing as the size of the primes get larger~~ ~~ d being negative caused this
- Started working on the UI to make the program properly usable
- Added some benchmark for the relevant functions
- ~~Some testing, still more needs to be done~~
- ~~Started working on the tests coverage~~, never done this before with Rust
- Coverage done
- Allowed issues
- A few benchmarks for next week, and the UI, and the project is pretty much done
