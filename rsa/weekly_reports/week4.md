- Implemented working version of the extended Euclidean algorithm, d calculation works now
- The core functionality now done
- Still some strange bug which makes the program crash sometimes, the frequency seems to be increasing as the size of the primes get larger
- Started working on the UI to make the program properly usable
- Added some benchmark for the relevant functions
- Some testing, still more needs to be done
- Started working on the tests coverage, never done this before with Rust
- Allowed issues
