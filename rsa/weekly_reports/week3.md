## Week 3

- Worked on key generation, ~~still unsure if d is correct~~.
- Started benchmarking.
- Reworked on the file structure a bit.
- Started working on encryption and decryption
- Encryption works now on small p and q, problems calculating d with larger p and q
- *The key size and the message length have to match, so 8 bits per character in message*
- Padding required
