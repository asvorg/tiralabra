## Week 1

- Started on working on generating the required prime numbers.
- Small prime generation is working(around 20 digits long), still work to do to get it working with bigger ones
- I learned a lot about small algorithms regarding the generation of prime numbers.
- Problems with typing and very large numbers. U128 is too small for the required size of the numbers
- Next I will try to solve the problems stated above, after that working on key generation.
