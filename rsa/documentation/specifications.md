## Specifications

- RSA implementation done in Rust.
- All the needed prime number generations will be implemented by me, as well as the relevant key generations.
- Also actual text encryption will be possible
- RSA relies on big prime numbers.
- The final program will only take text as an input and return the RSA encypted text, probably in ASCII
- Time complexity still unclear
- I am a TKT student
- The whole project will be done in english
