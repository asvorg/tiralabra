# Specifications

- RSA implementation done in Rust.
- All the needed prime number generations will be implemented by me, as well as the relevant key generations.
- The primes will be generated by running a randomly generated number first through low level primality test and then checking with the Miller Rabin primality test if the number is prime.
- D calculated using the extended Euclidean algorithm
- Also actual text encryption will be possible
- The final program will only take text as an input and return the RSA encypted text, UTF-8
- Time complexity still unclear
- I am a TKT student
- The whole project will be done in english
